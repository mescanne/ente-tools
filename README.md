# ente-tools

Ente tools are a collection of Python based libraries and command line to interact with [Ente](https://ente.io/).

## Why?

Ente is an end-to-end encrypted open source photo backup and sharing solution that offers both a self-hosted and a paid offering.

This set of tools are intended to be a prototype to building an open source ecosystem around the self-hosted offering.
